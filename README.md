# Recommender-System-Algos
This project aims to build a comprehensive course recommendation engine by integrating multiple machine learning techniques. It leverages both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering approaches to provide personalized course suggestions to users based on their profiles and interaction histories.



## Techniques Used
1) PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

2) K-Means Clustering

3) KNN Collaborative Filtering

4) NMF Collaborative Filtering

5) Neural Networks with TensorFlow

6) Bag of Words (BoW)

7) WordCloud Visualization

8) Regression Models


## Objectives
Compute similarity between courses using a course similarity matrix.

Recommend new courses similar to a user's enrolled courses.

Use K-Means clustering on original and PCA-transformed user feature vectors to discover user groups.

Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality of user profile features.

Recommend courses based on group-wise enrollment patterns.

Implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) collaborative filtering on the user-item interaction matrix.

Implement Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) collaborative filtering.

Train neural networks using TensorFlow to learn latent features for users and items.

Predict course ratings using the trained neural network model.

Calculate similarity between any two courses using Bag of Words (BoW) feature vectors.

Identify course title keywords using WordCloud visualization.

Generate summary statistics and visualizations of the course content dataset.

Determine the most popular course genres.

Analyze the course enrollment dataset to identify trends and most-enrolled courses.

Extract BoW features from course titles and descriptions to support content-based recommendations.

Build regression models to predict course ratings using combined embedding vectors.
