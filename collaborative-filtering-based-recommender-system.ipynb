It is probably the simplest but very effective and intuitive collaborative filtering algorithm. Since it is based on KNN, it inherits the main characteristics of KNN such as memory-intensive because you need to maintain a huge similarity matrix among users or items. In the future notebooks, we will learn other types of collaborative filtering which do not rely on such a huge similarity matrix to make rating predictions.\n","metadata":{}}]}
